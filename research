Malloc research


This project can t use malloc for internal functionnement
This project shall pre alloc small and meedium sized alloc

La taille des allocs dois etre un multiple de getpagesize

MMAP
- Ask system to give me mem
arg:
 1 - addr = 

MUNMAP
- Give back mem to system
How munmap() handles a dirty page, depends on what type of memory is being
unmapped:

#this to func are slow i shall limit call to them for better perf

GETPAGESIZE
The getpagesize() function returns the number of bytes in a page.  Page
granularity is the granularity of many of the memory management calls.
The page size is a system page size and may not be the same as the underly-ing 
hardware page size.


GETRLIMIT
Limits on the consumption of system resources by the current process and
each process it creates may be obtained with the getrlimit() call, and set
with the setrlimit() call.

Malloc()
	allocate mem
	Tiny 1 to 100 octet
	medium 101 to 10000 octet
	Large  10001 to 100000 octet
Free()
	if ptr == NULL do nothing
	
	in case of error return NULL
Realloc()
	Realloc
	if no more place in the current allocation
	create a larger one
	
	in case of error return NULL



technical term:

- Page Size:
		Page size is a unit defined by the system wich represent a certain ammount of data
